We will design a web app called Learning Log (using Django in Python)
that allows users to log the topics they are interested in and to make
journal entries as they learn about each topic.  The Learning Log homepage
will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in.  Once
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries and read/edit
existing entries.
